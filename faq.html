          <h2 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions from Startups Applying to the Awesome Fellowship</h2> <br />
          <h3>Is it true that all this awesomeness is free?</h3><p>Yes, we're here to help your company. We're entrepreneurs and know what it's like to get started. We 
                    recognize that early-stage companies are often strapped for cash, so we don't want to take a chunk out
                    of your already limited resources. This also aligns our incentives long-term. We only succeed if you succeed,
                    so our team is committed to helping you out for the life of your startup (and likely beyond that).</p>
            <h3></a>Why does Awesome Inc do this?</h3>
            <p>We’re entrepreneurs ourselves, and we believe in the power of entrepreneurs to change the world. Our vision for the future requires that more entrepreneurs achieve success, so we’re doing something to help make that happen.</p>
          <h3>What type of companies is Awesome Inc looking for?</h3><p>We are seeking companies that create or utilize web and mobile software to deliver value to their customers. We have funded both b2b and b2c companies in industries ranging from sports and pets to hospitality and healthcare.</p>
          <h3>What is it like at Awesome Inc’s physical space?</h3><p>We have a 6000-square-foot multipurpose space, which includes coworking hotdesks and a conference room. There’s also a dance floor, a ping pong table, a lounge area with kitchen and couches, and even a raw garage space. Check out the pictures 
                    <a href="http://360.io/RNmufF">here</a>
                    and <a href="http://360.io/NAgcW4">here</a>.</p>
           <p>Our location in downtown Lexington is a few blocks from the University of Kentucky, home to nearly 30,000 students, including strong Computer Science and Design programs. There are several coffee shops, restaurants, and tall buildings within walking distance.</p>
          <h3>Who are you guys?</h3>
          <p>Awesome Inc was founded in 2009 (you can read <a href="http://awesomeinc.org#w2" target="_blank">about our history and founding team</a>). Our program managers for 2013 are <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianraney" target="_blank">Brian Raney</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicksuch" target="_blank">Nick Such</a>. Both are entrepreneurs from technical backgrounds. In addition to running several technology companies, they have founded an organization for young entrepreneurs, launched the <a href="http://entrepreneurhof.com" target="_blank">Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame</a>, organized six <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Startup Weekends</a>, run a 5-city <a href="http://mobilexconference.com/" target="_blank">mobile industry conference series</a>, and have <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100110" target="_blank">spoken at the SXSW Interactive festival</a>.</p>
          <p>While studying Computer Science in college, Brian started his first web company, BookExchange.com, a peer-to-peer textbook marketplace. He grew the company to a network of universities, secured a deal with eCampus.com, and was in acquisition talks with Facebook. Those talks lasted for about 2 minutes and resulted in a quick “no”, but Brian turned his traction with BookExchange into the basis for Apax Software, a fast-growing web and mobile app consultancy with clients around the US. Brian also serves as the first Entrepreneur in Residence at the University of Kentucky.</p>
          <p>Nick, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_%22Maize_%26_Blue%22_University_of_Michigan_Solar_Car#Team" target="_blank">Larry Page</a>, got his start designing and racing solar-powered cars. Following stints at GE, Toyota, and early-stage venture capital firm KSTC, Nick founded Awesome Labs to help engineering students turn their class projects into startups. Resulting from that program, he co-founded two technology companies in human-computer interaction and mapping/location. He once thought he wanted to get an MBA, but <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/an-mba-dream-deferred-08242011.html" target="_blank">eventually came to his senses</a>.</p>
          <h3>How much time will I get to spend with mentors?</h3>
          <p>This varies based on mentor availability and team needs. Some will stop by to enjoy a meal and share some of their entrepreneurial war stories. Others will form a relationship with teams that will last well beyond the duration of the program. Our mentors do have busy schedules, but they signed on for this role because the process of mentoring provides mutual benefits. Be sure to ask your mentors what they’d like to get out of the relationship (staying up on trends, passion for your market, a chance to “ride the rollercoaster” once again, etc).</p>
          <h3>What are some teams that have been through this program before?</h3>
          <p>This is the first year for the Awesome Fellowship Program. You can see the companies that are currently participating under the 'Companies' tab. We have also helped to grow several companies previously. Check out our <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org#db" target="_blank">portfolio companies and tenants</a>. We strongly encourage you to chat with the founders of these companies, who can share advice on applying, as well as their perspective on the ups and downs of the program.</p>
          <h3>Who are the investors in the program?</h3>
          <p>Our investors are individual angels investors, many with experience as founders of multiple high-growth technology companies.</p>
          <h3>Will my team be required to relocate to Lexington?</h3>
          <p>No, your team does not need to relocate to Lexington for the duration of the program. However, we do encourage frequent visits to the Awesome Inc space as there is strong value in physical community and learning from fellow teams who participate in our program.</p>
          <h3>When does the program start? How long does it last?</h3>
          <p>The program accepts teams on a rolling basis. The length of the program will vary for each team. We will support your startup for up to one year after you are accepted.</p>
          <h3>What if I have more questions? How do I contact someone at Awesome Inc?</h3>
          <p>We're available via email: <a href="mailto:theresa@awesomeinc.org?Subject=Awesome%20Inc%20Fellowship">theresa@awesomeinc.org</a> or you can reach out on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/awesome_inc">@awesome_inc</a>.</p>
